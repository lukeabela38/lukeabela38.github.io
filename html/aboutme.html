            My Background
        </div>

        <div class="card-body">
            Hello there, I am Luke, a 20-something tech geek. Devops Engineer by day and Electrical and Electronics Engineer by degree, I also pursued a Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence specialising in Language Artificial Intelligence and its applications
            to Social Media. Since then I have also worked as a research assistant on Optical Character Recognition, a domain associated with imagery. I am a jack of all trades as opposed to a master of one, and love nothing more than coding away and
            making my night time ideas come to life.

        <div class="card">
            Motivations
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
            From approximately 2019 to 2023, I regularly followed and enjoyed the content of the TIFO Football channel on youtube, a channel which introduced me to the concept data analytics applied to sport, and how a computer nerd could be a league winning asset.
            I would love to say the Moneyball filmed captured my imagination, but I have no standing interest in baseball. My interests instead lie in Tabletennis. A sport which I played in my teens and have since returned to in my twenties, a sport which
            I noticed was lacking a true analytical presence.
