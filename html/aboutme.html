                                Intelligence from Queen Mary, University of London. I have 2 years’ experience as a
                                DevOps Engineer and 3 years’ experience as a Machine Learning Engineer. Throughout my
                                career I have
                                acquired strong development, operational, and cloud knowledge, the combination of which
                                has seen me contribute significantly to saving over $200,000 annually for my current
                                company through cost savings measures.In my previous
                                job I was collaborating with Nvidia Software Developers on their machine learning
                                solutions for Speech AI solutions. Prior to this I had obtained my Bachelor of
                                Engineering (Hons) In Electrical and Electrical Engineering from the University of
                                Malta.

                            <p class="card-text"> From approximately 2019 to 2023, I regularly followed and enjoyed the
                                content of the TIFO Football channel on youtube, a channel which introduced me to the
                                concept data analytics applied to sport, and how a computer nerd could
                                be a league winning asset. I would love to say the Moneyball filmed captured my
                                imagination, but I have no standing interest in baseball. My interests instead lie in
                                Tabletennis. A sport which I played in my teens and have
                                since returned to in my twenties, a sport which I noticed was lacking a true analytical
                                presence.</p>
